## My Pic Stats
This is a simple project that I am building to allow me to keep track of some of my stats for my instagram account.  If it actually get's to the point where it is useful, then I'll be looking at changing it into a product.

### Next Steps
#### One a day tasks

* ~~Save the access token to localstorage so we don't have to go back to instagram every time~~
* ~~Integrate firebase authentication~~
* ~~Password Protect the site~~
* ~~move the access token to the cloud~~
* ~~Store the endpoint results in the cloud~~
* Design Login Page
* Get the first chart populated with data
* Come up with three thought out metrics and put the chrome up on the dashboard
* Fix db access rules
* Fix initial user login bug (data doesn't show until navigation)
* ~~Add redux~~
* Grab data from redux
